## Overview
This repository is an exhibition of a software engineering team profile generator. The user can consult the repo to learn how to create a command-line application that dynamically generates an HTML webpage from a user's input using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer" target="_blank">Inquirer Package</a>. The user can also consult the repo to learn how to implement unit testing for their project using the  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest" target="_blank">Jest Package</a>.  

## Why does Test Driven Development matter?
In the development phase, developers only spend time and effort as an expense so their goal is always to try and save time. This does not meaning coding faster, it means coding effectively and efficiently. Bugs, defects, and errors all cause time loss. This repository includes an instance of TTD known as Unit Testing, which aims to test units and components that are the smallest piece of code in isolation of the system as a whole.
